 * takes to reset bone transformations.
 *
 * @param boneResetTime                       The specified time duration (in ticks or seconds) for resetting bones to
 *                                            their default transformations when animations are interrupted.
 * @param crashIfBoneMissing                  Specifies whether the system will throw an exception if an expected bone
 *                                            in the animation is not found during runtime.
 * @param shouldPlayAnimationsWhileGamePaused Indicates whether animations should continue playing when the game is
 *                                            paused.
